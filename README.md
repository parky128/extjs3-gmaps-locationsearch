# extjs3-gmaps-locationsearch
Google Maps location search tool built with ExtJS3

This demonstrates how the Google Maps API geocoder service can be used in conjunction with ExtJS3 components to return matching addresses as the user keys in the combo box. Matching results are automatically shown.

## To Do List ##
* Add a clear button next to the combo control
* Allow results to be selectable
* Add a selected result map marker
* Style the results in the expandable listbox from the combo so that matching parts of what user entered get highlighted, e.g. if user enters 'Lon' and 'London, UK' gets returned in the list of results, shade the 'Lon' part of the result text
